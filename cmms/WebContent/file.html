	<strong><u>1. BACKGROUND</u>
	</strong>
</p>
<p>As announced back in November 2012 in the Mauritian Budget Speech
	2013, the government is aiming to increase thecontrol and management
	requirements that GBC 1 companies will need to fulfill in order to
	benefit from DTAAs.After discussing with relevant stakeholders in that
	respect, the FSC has brought amendments to Section 3 of Chapter 4 of
	the Guide to Global Business on 4 September 2013. The objective of this
	measure is to bring the control and management requirements in
	Mauritius in line with OECD&rsquo;s expectations andfurther improve the
	image of Mauritius as a clean and well-regulated international
	financial centre..</p>
<p>GBC 1 companies will have till 1 January 2015 to implement these
	new control and management requirements.</p>
<p>
	<strong><u>2. AMENDMENTS</u>
	</strong>
</p>
<p>The amendments which have been brought to the new Chapter 4 of
	the Guide to Global Business are as follows:</p>

	<strong><u>3. IMPLICATIONS</u>
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Treaty benefits</strong>&nbsp;
	&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>As from 1 January 2015, all GBC 1s wishing to avail treaty
	benefits will have to demonstrate additionalcontrol and management in
	Mauritius apart from the existing ones (that is Section 3.2 of Chapter
	4 of the FSC Guide). The GBC 1 will however have a choice on how to
	demonstrate the additional control and management requirements (that is
	the new Section 3.3 of the amended Chapter 4 of the FSC Guide). A GBC 1
	can thus meet at least one of the following additional criteria:</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have an
	office in Mauritius;</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employ
	at least 1 administrative/technical staff in Mauritius;</p>
<p>
	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having an
	arbitration clause in its Constitution whereby all disputes arising out
	of the constitution shall be resolved by way of arbitration in
	Mauritius<a
		href="file:///C:/Users/abc/Downloads/Enhanced%20Control%20and%20Management%20-%20%20Amendment%20to%20FSC%20Guide%20-%2004-1.10.13%20-%20final...docx#_ftn1"
		name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.;
</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold
	assets (excluding cash and shares/interests) of at least USD 100,000;</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List its
	shares on a securities exchange in Mauritius; or</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incur
	expenditure in Mauritius as might be expected of a similar corporation
	in Mauritius.</p>
<p>Therefore, a GBC 1 may not obtain a Tax Residence Certificate if
	the new control and management requirements are not met.</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collective
		Investment Schemes</strong>
</p>
<p>Collective investment schemes, closed end funds and external
	pension schemes having a GBC 1 licence should be administered from
	Mauritius and demonstrate the enhanced control and management as per
	Section 3.3 of Chapter 4. Currently, most of the collective investment
	schemes are administered from Mauritius, and therefore this new
	requirement will not be onerous on existing collective investment
	schemes.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp; the other requirements mentioned in 3.2 above
	(that is, office in Mauritius, employing staff, arbitration clause,
	holding of assets, listing or incurring expenditure) would also apply
	to collective investment schemes holding a GBC 1 licence. These new
	requirements may have an impact on the NAV of some collective
	investment schemes but there is the possibility of choosing the less
	costly option among any one of the new control and management
	requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Related Corporation</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A GBC 1 would be deemed to comply with the new control and management
	requirements &nbsp;&nbsp;if a related corporationalready complies with
	same. A related corporation refers to a subsidiary, fellow subsidiary<a
		href="file:///C:/Users/abc/Downloads/Enhanced%20Control%20and%20Management%20-%20%20Amendment%20to%20FSC%20Guide%20-%2004-1.10.13%20-%20final...docx#_ftn2"
		name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>, a parent corporation or any other
	corporation within the same group.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FSC Circular Letter
		&ndash; Additional Requirements for resident directors</strong>
</p>
<p>The FSC has also imposed additional requirements on resident
	directors through the FSC Circular Letter dated 28 March 2013. The
	Circular Letter provides that resident directors of licensees of the
	FSC (including GBC 1s and CIS) should:</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have
	relevant qualification and experience to exercise sufficient care,
	diligence and skills for the good conduct of the business;</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Act with
	integrity and freedom of mind, without any influence, interest of
	relationship that might impair his professional judgment or
	objectivity;</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide
	impartial and good judgement in his duties; and</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure
	that sufficient time and attention is given to affairs of each board on
	which the director sits by adequately preparing for each meeting,
	attending all meetings, actively participate in board deliberations
	etc.</p>
<p>The FSC will consider all the above factors upon the receipt of
	application for a new licence, on the renewal of an existing licence or
	on approval/ notification ofappointments of new directors.</p>
<p>The FSC has not defined what would amount to relevant
	qualification or experience. It seems that the FSC will consider the
	previous professional experience of a person and his/her academic or
	other qualifications, and thereby determine whether that person can
	fulfill his/her duties as director of a company.</p>
<p>The global business industry has reacted positively to the above
	FSC Circular Letter as these new requirements on resident directors
	were issued following consultation with the industry.</p>
<p>
	<strong><u>4. COMMENTS</u>
	</strong>
</p>
<p>The enhanced control and management requirements may seem
	daunting for some GBC 1s. However these requirements are not completely
	new as some existing GBC 1s are already complying with some of them.The
	ability to choose among the different ways to demonstrate control and
	managementalso means that GBC 1s can go for the option best suited to
	them</p>
<p>It would seem from face value, that providing in the constitution
	for the seat of arbitration to be in Mauritius is the less costly and
	time-consuming option, assuming that the shareholders of a GBC 1
	consider arbitration as their option for resolving disputes arising out
	of the constitution.</p>
<p>On the other hand, employing staff, incurring expenditure,
	holding assets or listing on securities exchangesin Mauritius will help
	to consolidate and reaffirm a GBC 1&rsquo;s physical presence in
	Mauritius.These would therefore seem to be more credible options vis
	&agrave;vis tax authorities and are suitablefor companies aiming for
	tax certainty.</p>
<p>
	<strong><u>ANNEXURE</u>
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Model of Arbitration Clause</strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any dispute arising out of a breach of this Constitution
	is to be settled amicably between the Shareholders. In the event the
	Shareholders fail to resolve a dispute within a period of three (3)
	months of the date on which the dispute has arisen, the dispute shall
	be resolved by a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall take place in
	Mauritius and the language of the arbitration&rsquo;s proceeding shall
	be English. The arbitrator shall be a barrister entitled to practice
	law in Mauritius and shall be appointed by the mutual agreement of the
	Shareholders. On failure by the Shareholders to agree on the name of
	the arbitrator, any Shareholder may make an application to a Judge
	sitting in chambers for the appointment of such arbitrator. The award
	given by the arbitrator shall be conclusive, final and binding on all
	Shareholders and shall not be subject to appeal.&rdquo;</p>
